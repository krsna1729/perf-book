## Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis {#sec:TMA}

Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) methodology is a very powerful technique for identifying CPU bottlenecks in a program. The best part of this methodology is that it does not require a developer to have a deep understanding of the microarchitecture and PMCs in the system and still efficiently find CPU bottlenecks.

At a conceptual level, TMA identifies what is stalling the execution of a program. Figure @fig:TMA_concept illustrates the core idea of TMA. Here is a short guide on how to read this diagram. As we know from [@sec:uarch], there are internal buffers in the CPU that keep track of information about $\mu$ops that are being executed. Whenever a new instruction is fetched and decoded, new entries in those buffers are allocated. If a $\mu$op for the instruction was not allocated during a particular cycle of execution, it could be for one of two reasons: either we were not able to fetch and decode it (`Frontend Bound`), or the Backend was overloaded with work, and resources for the new $\mu$op could not be allocated (`Backend Bound`). If a $\mu$op was allocated and scheduled for execution but never retired, this means it came from a mispredicted path (`Bad Speculation`). Finally, `Retiring` represents a normal execution. It is the bucket where we want all our $\mu$ops to be, although there are exceptions which we will talk about later.

This is not how the analysis works in practice because analyzing every single microoperation ($\mu$op) would be terribly slow. Instead, TMA observes the execution of a program by monitoring a specific set of performance events and then calculates metrics based on predefined formulas. Using these metrics, TMA characterizes the program by assigning it to one of the four high-level buckets. Each of the four high-level categories has several nested levels, which CPU vendors may choose to implement differently. Each generation of processors may have different formulas for calculating those metrics, so it's better to rely on tools to do the analysis rather than trying to calculate them yourself.

In the upcoming sections, we will discuss the TMA implementation in AMD, Arm, and Intel processors.
