# Appendix A. Reducing Measurement Noise {.unnumbered}

\markboth{Appendix A}{Appendix A}

Below are some examples of features that can contribute to increased non-determinism in performance measurements and a few techniques to reduce noise. I provided an introduction to the topic in [@sec:secFairExperiments].

This section is mostly specific to the Linux operating system. Readers are encouraged to search the web for instructions on how to configure other operating systems.

## Dynamic Frequency Scaling {.unnumbered .unlisted}

[Dynamic Frequency Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling)[^11] (DFS) is a technique to increase the performance of a system by automatically raising CPU operating frequency when it runs demanding tasks. As an example of DFS implementation, Intel CPUs have a feature called Turbo Boost, and AMD CPUs employ Turbo Core functionality. 

Here is an example of the impact Turbo Boost can make for a single-threaded workload running on Intel® Core™ i5-8259U:

```bash
# TurboBoost enabled
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
0
$ perf stat -e task-clock,cycles -- ./a.exe 
    11984.691958  task-clock (msec) #    1.000 CPUs utilized
  32,427,294,227  cycles            #    2.706 GHz
      11.989164338 seconds time elapsed

# TurboBoost disabled
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
1
$ perf stat -e task-clock,cycles -- ./a.exe 
    13055.200832  task-clock (msec) #    0.993 CPUs utilized
  29,946,969,255  cycles            #    2.294 GHz
      13.142983989 seconds time elapsed
```

The average frequency is higher when Turbo Boost is on (2.7 GHz vs. 2.3 GHz).

DFS can be permanently disabled in BIOS. To programmatically disable the DFS feature on Linux systems, you need root access. Here is how one can achieve this:

```bash
# Intel
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
# AMD
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
```
## Simultaneous Multithreading {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Many modern CPU cores support simultaneous multithreading (see [@sec:SMT]). SMT can be permanently disabled in BIOS. To programmatically disable SMT on Linux systems, you need root access. The sibling pairs of CPU threads can be found in the following files:

```bash
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/topology/thread_siblings_list
```

Here is how you can disable a sibling thread of core 0 on Intel® Core™ i5-8259U, which has 4 cores and 8 threads:

```bash
# all 8 hardware threads enabled:
$ lscpu
...
CPU(s):              8
On-line CPU(s) list: 0-7
...
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/thread_siblings_list
0,4
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/topology/thread_siblings_list
1,5
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/topology/thread_siblings_list
2,6
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/topology/thread_siblings_list
3,7

# Disabling SMT on core 0
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online
0
$ lscpu
CPU(s):               8
On-line CPU(s) list:  0-3,5-7
Off-line CPU(s) list: 4
...
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/thread_siblings_list
0
```

Also, the `lscpu --all --extended` command can be very helpful to see the sibling threads.

## Scaling Governor {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Linux kernel can control CPU frequency for different purposes. One such purpose is to save power. In this case, the scaling governor may decide to decrease the CPU frequency. For performance measurements, it is recommended to set the scaling governor policy to `performance` to avoid sub-nominal clocking. Here is how we can set it for all the cores:

```bash
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy*/scaling_governor
```

## CPU Affinity {.unnumbered .unlisted}

[Processor affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity)[^8] enables the binding of a process to a certain CPU core(s). In Linux, you can do this with [`taskset`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/taskset)[^9] tool.

```bash
# no affinity
$ perf stat -e context-switches,cpu-migrations -r 10 -- a.exe
               151      context-switches
                10      cpu-migrations

# process is bound to the CPU0
$ perf stat -e context-switches,cpu-migrations -r 10 -- taskset -c 0 a.exe 
               102      context-switches
                 0      cpu-migrations
```

Notice the number of `cpu-migrations` gets down to `0`, i.e., the process never leaves `core0`.

Alternatively, you can use [cset](https://github.com/lpechacek/cpuset)[^10] tool to reserve CPUs for just the program you are benchmarking. If using `Linux perf`, leave at least two cores so that `perf` runs on one core, and your program runs in another. The command below will move all threads out of N1 and N2 (`-k on` means that even kernel threads are moved out):

```bash
$ cset shield -c N1,N2 -k on
```

The command below will run the command after `--` in the isolated CPUs: 
```bash
$ cset shield --exec -- perf stat -r 10 <cmd>
```

On Windows, a program can be pinned to a specific core using the following command:

```bash
$ start /wait /b /affinity 0xC0 myapp.exe
```

where the `/wait` option waits for the application to terminate, `/b` starts the application without opening a new command window, and `/affinity` specifies the CPU affinity mask. In this case, the mask `0xC0` means that the application will run on cores 6 and 7.

On macOS, it is not possible to pin threads to cores since the operating system does not provide an API for that.

## Process Priority {.unnumbered .unlisted}

In Linux, you can increase process priority using the `nice` tool. By increasing priority, the process gets more CPU time, and the scheduler favors it more in comparison with processes with normal priority. Niceness ranges from `-20` (highest priority value) to `19` (lowest priority value) with the default of `0`.

Notice in the previous example, that the execution of the benchmarked process was interrupted by the OS more than 100 times. If we increase process priority by running the benchmark with `sudo nice -n -<N>`:

```bash
$ perf stat -r 10 -- sudo nice -n -5 taskset -c 1 a.exe
    0   context-switches
    0   cpu-migrations
```

Notice the number of context switches gets to `0`, so the process received all the computation time uninterrupted.
