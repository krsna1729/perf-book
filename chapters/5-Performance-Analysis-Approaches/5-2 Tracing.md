## Tracing

Tracing is conceptually very similar to instrumentation, yet slightly different. Code instrumentation assumes that the user has full access to the source code of their application. On the other hand, tracing relies on the existing instrumentation. For example, the `strace` tool enables us to trace system calls and can be thought of as instrumentation of the Linux kernel. Intel Processor Traces (Intel PT, see Appendix C) enable you to log instructions executed by a processor and can be thought of as instrumentation of a CPU. Traces can be obtained from components that were appropriately instrumented in advance and are not subject to change. Tracing is often used as a black-box approach, where a user cannot modify the code of an application, yet they want to get insights into what the program is doing.

An example of tracing system calls with the Linux `strace` tool is provided in [@lst:strace], which shows the first several lines of output when running the `git status` command. By tracing system calls with `strace` it's possible to know the timestamp for each system call (the leftmost column), its exit status (after the `=` sign), and the duration of each system call (in angle brackets).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The overhead of tracing depends on what exactly we try to trace. For example, if we trace a program that rarely makes system calls, the overhead of running it under `strace` will be close to zero. On the other hand, if we trace a program that heavily relies on system calls, the overhead could be very large, e.g. 100x.[^1] Also, tracing can generate a massive amount of data since it doesn't skip any sample. To compensate for this, tracing tools provide filters that enable you to restrict data collection to a specific time slice or for a specific section of code.

Similar to instrumentation, tracing can be used for exploring anomalies in a system. For example, you may want to determine what was going on in an application during a 10s period of unresponsiveness. As you will see later, sampling methods are not designed for this, but with tracing, you can see what leads to the program being unresponsive. For example, with Intel PT, you can reconstruct the control flow of the program and know exactly what instructions were executed.

Tracing is also very useful for debugging. Its underlying nature enables "record and replay" use cases based on recorded traces. One such tool is the Mozilla [rr](https://rr-project.org/)[^2] debugger, which performs record and replay of processes, supports backward single stepping, and much more. Most tracing tools are capable of decorating events with timestamps, which enables us to find correlations with external events that were happening during that time. That is, when we observe a glitch in a program, we can take a look at the traces of our application and correlate this glitch with what was happening in the whole system during that time.
