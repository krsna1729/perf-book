## Software and Hardware Timers {#sec:timers}

To benchmark execution time, engineers usually use two different timers, which all the modern platforms provide:

 - **System-wide high-resolution timer**: this is a system timer that is typically implemented as a simple count of the number of ticks that have transpired since an arbitrary starting date, called the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing))[^1]. This clock is monotonic; i.e., it always goes up. System time can be retrieved from the OS with a system call. Accessing the system timer on Linux systems is possible via the `clock_gettime` system call. The system timer has a nanosecond resolution, is consistent between all the CPUs, and is independent of the CPU frequency. Even though the system timer can return timestamps with a nanosecond accuracy, it is not suitable for measuring short-running events because it takes a long time to obtain the timestamp via the `clock_gettime` system call. But it is OK to measure events with a duration of more than a microsecond. The standard way of accessing the system timer in C++ is using `std::chrono` as shown in [@lst:Chrono].

   Listing: Using C++ std::chrono to access system timer
   
   ~~~~ {#lst:Chrono .cpp}
   #include <cstdint>
   #include <chrono>

   // returns elapsed time in nanoseconds
   uint64_t timeWithChrono() {
     using namespace std::chrono;
     auto start = steady_clock::now();
     // run something
     auto end = steady_clock::now();
     uint64_t delta = duration_cast<nanoseconds>(end - start).count();
     return delta;
   }
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
 - **Time Stamp Counter (TSC)**: this is a hardware timer that is implemented as a hardware register. TSC is monotonic and has a constant rate, i.e., it doesn't account for frequency changes. Every CPU has its own TSC, which is simply the number of reference cycles (see [@sec:secRefCycles]) elapsed. It is suitable for measuring short events with a duration from nanoseconds up to one minute. On x86 platforms, the value of TSC can be retrieved by using the compiler's built-in function `__rdtsc` as shown in [@lst:TSC], which uses the `RDTSC` assembly instruction under the hood. More low-level details on benchmarking the code using the `RDTSC` assembly instruction can be found in the white paper [@IntelRDTSC]. On ARM platforms you can read `CNTVCT_EL0`, Counter-timer Virtual Count Register.

   Listing: Using __rdtsc compiler builtins to access TSC

   ~~~~ {#lst:TSC .cpp}
   #include <x86intrin.h>
   #include <cstdint>

   // returns the number of elapsed reference clocks
   uint64_t timeWithTSC() {
       uint64_t start = __rdtsc();
       // run something
       return __rdtsc() - start;
   }
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing which timer to use is very simple and depends on how long the thing is that you want to measure. If you measure something over a very short time period, TSC will give you better accuracy. Conversely, it's pointless to use the TSC to measure a program that runs for hours. Unless you need cycle accuracy, the system timer should be enough for a large proportion of cases. It's important to keep in mind that accessing the system timer usually has a higher latency than accessing TSC. Making a `clock_gettime` system call can be much slower than executing `RDTSC` instruction. The latter takes about 5 ns (20 CPU cycles), while the former takes about 500 ns. This may become important for minimizing measurement overhead, especially in the production environment. A performance comparison of different APIs for accessing timers on various platforms is available on the wiki page of the CppPerformanceBenchmarks repository.[^3]
