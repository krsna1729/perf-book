## Basic Block {#sec:BasicBlock}

A *basic block* is a sequence of instructions with a single entry and a single exit. Figure @fig:BasicBlock shows a simple example of a basic block, where the `MOV` instruction is an entry, and `JA` is an exit instruction. Basic block `BB1` is a *predecessor* of basic block `BB2` if the control flow can go from `BB1` to `BB2`. Similarly, basic block `BB3` is a *successor* of basic block `BB2` if the control flow can go from `BB2` to `BB3`. While a basic block can have one or many predecessors and successors, no instruction in the middle can enter or exit a basic block.

It is guaranteed that every instruction in the basic block will be executed only once. This is an important property that is leveraged by many compiler transformations. For example, it greatly reduces the problem of control flow graph analysis and transformations since, for some classes of problems, we can treat all instructions in the basic block as one entity.
