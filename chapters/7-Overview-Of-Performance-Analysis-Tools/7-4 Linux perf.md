## Linux Perf

Linux Perf is probably the most used performance profiler in the world since it is available on most Linux distributions, which makes it accessible to a wide range of users. Perf is natively supported in many popular Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian. It is included in the kernel, so you can get OS-level statistics (page faults, CPU migrations, etc.) on any system that runs Linux. As of mid-2024, the profiler supports x86, ARM, PowerPC64, UltraSPARC, and a few other CPU types.[^2] On such platforms, `perf` provides access to the hardware performance monitoring features, for example, performance counters. More information about Linux `perf` is available on its [wiki page](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)[^1].

### How to configure it {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Installing Linux perf is very simple and can be done with a single command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
```

Also, consider changing the following defaults unless security is a concern:

```bash
# Allow kernel profiling and access to CPU events for unprivileged users
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
$ echo kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
# Enable kernel modules symbols resolution for unprivileged users
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
$ echo kernel.kptr_restrict=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
```

### What you can do with it: {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Generally, Linux `perf` can do most of the same things that other profilers can do. Hardware vendors prioritize enabling their features in Linux `perf` so that by the time a new CPU is available on the market, `perf` already supports it. There are two main commands that most people use. The first, `perf stat`, reports a count of specified performance events. The second, `perf record`, profiles an application or system in sampling mode and is often followed by `perf report` to generate a report from the sampling data.

The output of the `perf record` command is a raw dump of samples. Many tools, built on top of Linux `perf`, parse raw dump files and provide new analysis types. Here are the most notable ones:

- Flame graphs, discussed in [@sec:secFlameGraphs].
- [KDAB Hotspot](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot),[^3] a tool that visualizes Linux `perf` data with an interface very similar to Intel VTune. If you have worked with Intel VTune, KDAB Hotspot will seem very familiar to you.
- Netflix [Flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope).[^4] This tool displays a heat map of sampled events over application runtime. You can observe different phases and patterns in the behavior of a workload. Netflix engineers found some very subtle performance bugs using this tool. Also, you can select a time range on the heat map and generate a flame graph for that time range.

### What you cannot do with it: {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Linux perf is a command-line tool and lacks a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which makes it hard to filter data, observe how the workload behavior changes over time, zoom into a portion of the runtime, etc. There is a limited console output provided through the `perf report` command, which is fine for quick analysis, although not as convenient as other GUI profilers. Luckily, as we just mentioned, there are GUI tools that can post-process and visualize the raw output of Linux `perf`.
