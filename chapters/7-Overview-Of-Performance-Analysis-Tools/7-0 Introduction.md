# Overview of Performance Analysis Tools {#sec:secOverviewPerfTools}

In the previous chapter, we explored the features implemented in modern processors to aid performance analysis. However, if you were to start directly using those features, it would become very nuanced very quickly as it requires a lot of low-level programming to make use of them. Luckily, performance analysis tools take care of all the complexity that is required to effectively use these hardware performance monitoring features. This makes profiling go smoothly, but it's still critical to have an intuition of how such tools obtain and interpret the data. That is why we now discuss analysis tools only after we have discussed CPU performance monitoring features.

This chapter gives a quick overview of the most popular performance analysis tools available on major platforms. Some of the tools are cross-platform but the majority are not, so it is important to know what tools are available to you. Profiling tools are usually developed and maintained by hardware vendors themselves because they are the ones who know how to properly use performance monitoring features available on their processors. So, the choice of a tool for advanced performance engineering work depends on which operating system and CPU you're using.

After reading the chapter, take the time to practice using tools that you may eventually use. Familiarize yourself with the interface and workflow of those tools. Profile the application that you work with daily. Even if you don't find any actionable insights, you will be much better prepared when the actual need arises.
