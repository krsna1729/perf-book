# Other Tuning Areas {#sec:ChapterOtherTuning}

In this chapter, we will take a look at some of the optimization topics not specifically related to any of the categories covered in the previous three chapters, but still important enough to find their place in this book.

We will start by discussing how to introduce CPU-specific optimizations in your code. Then we will cover some of the corner case situations that can have a measurable impact on the performance of your application. Next, we move on to exploring low-latency tuning techniques, which are essential for applications that require fast response times. Finally, we will provide advice for tuning the system settings.
